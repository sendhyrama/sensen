# About Me

I am Sendhy Ramadhinata, a 3rd-year Information System student at **[UPN Veteran Jawa Timur](https://www.upnjatim.ac.id)**.

I have interest in Frontend Development and  UI/UX Design. Focusing on technologies for Frontend Web Development with 
JavaScript-based ecosystems, such as Next.js, Chakra UI, and Headless CMS (Contentful, DatoCMS, or the one provided by Netlify).

Learning new technologies is essential for me since, in the future, I think illiteracy will be defined as the inability to read 
programming languages.

In most of my time, I often explore some useful resources, and taking any courses to rank up my skills. Also working 
on paid projects if there's an opportunity.

Aside from programming stuff, I like to refresh my life by playing some games and travelling alone.

Anw, you can read more about my articles related to programming on my **[Dev.to](https://dev.to/sendhyrama)**.

## Development Tech

### - Frontend

I know a few of front-end frameworks, **React**, **Next**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and
**Astro**. My favorite build tool is **Vite**, because it's the fastest one I've
ever used.

### - Styling

As for the styling, I usually go with **CSS**, if not then it's **Bootstrap**,
I also look for another UI component frameworks at times. On to bigger projects,
I use **Chakra/Headless** with plugins, or maybe just **Tailwind**.

### - Backend

Back then before I knew about Node.js, I used **PHP** and the **Laravel**
framework, but now I change over to **Express**. About databases, I always use
**MySQL**, but I do plan to use another database in the future, probably
**MongoDB**.

### - Miscellaneous

Services that I use for hosting is either **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)**
or **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**. I know how to manage domains,
a small Linux server, and also a cPanel.
