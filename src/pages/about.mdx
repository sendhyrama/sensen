# About Me

I am Sendhy Ramadhinata, a 3rd-year Information System student at UPN Veteran Jawa Timur. 

I have extensive experience in front-end development and love to learn all of new things. I'm currently learning back-end and multi-platform development besides studying university courses as part of my degree.

Learning new technologies is essential for me since, in the future, I think illiteracy will be defined as the inability to read programming languages.

Aside from programming stuff, I enjoy playing simulation racing, â€” especially Formula 1, and began competing in the Indo Formula League and winning the Spain Grand Prix.

## Development Tech

### Front-End

I know a few of front-end frameworks, **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and
**Astro**. My favorite build tool is **Vite**, because it's the fastest one I've
ever used.

### Styling

As for the styling, I usually go with **CSS**, if not then it's **Bootstrap**,
I also look for another UI component frameworks at times. On to bigger projects,
I use **PostCSS** with plugins, or maybe just **Tailwind**.

### Back-End

Back then before I knew about Node.js, I used **PHP** and the **Laravel**
framework, but now I change over to **Express**. About databases, I always use
**MySQL**, but I do plan to use another database in the future, probably
**MongoDB**.

### Miscellaneous

Services that I use for hosting is either **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)**
or **[Vercel](https://vercel.net)**. I know how to manage domains,
a small Linux server, and also a cPanel.

I use **Windows** as operating system and **VSCode** for the code editor. And
obviously, I use **Git**.

## Recap

To summarize, here is the list of technologies that I have used so far:

- **Front-End:** HTML, React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, Vite.
- **Style:** CSS, Bootstrap, PostCSS, Tailwind.
- **Back-End:** PHP, Laravel, Express, Node.
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB.
- **Service:** Netlify, Vercel, cPanel.
- **Workspace:** Win 11, VSCode, Git.
